If such a label exists and a name immediately follows it on the same line, extract that name and assign it as the value of 'studentName' in the output JSON object. If the Name label is not followed by a name on the same line or if the label does not exist, use 'Kinobere' as the studentName. For the rest of the content, transcribe only the exam questions into an array of entries. Each entry must be a JSON object with exactly the following keys: 'questionNo', 'question', 'answer', and 'grading'. The output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n",

If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.

If such a label exists and a name immediately follows it on the same line, extract that name and assign it as the value of 'studentName' in the output JSON object. If the Name label is not followed by a name on the same line or if the label does not exist, use 'Kinobere' as the studentName. For the rest of the content, transcribe only the exam questions into an array of entries. Each entry must be a JSON object with exactly the following keys: 'questionNo', 'question', 'answer', and 'grading'. The output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n",

If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.

If such a label exists and a name immediately follows it on the same line, extract that name and assign it as the value of 'studentName' in the output JSON object. If the Name label is not followed by a name on the same line or if the label does not exist, use 'Kinobere' as the studentName.

If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.

      "{ \"studentName\": \"<Extracted or default name>\", \"entries\": [ { \"questionNo\": \"<Question number>\", \"question\": \"<Question text>\", \"answer\": \"<Answer text>\", \"grading\": \"<Correct/Incorrect/Not Graded or empty string>\" }, ... ] } For questions with multiple parts (e.g., 36(a)), if there are multiple answers, produce a separate entry for each answer, repeating the question text for each part. If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks.\n",

      "In this image, first identify if there is a field at the top of the page explicitly labelled 'Name' followed by a colon or on the right of a label 'Name:' on the same line. If such a label exists and a name immediately follows it on the same line, extract that name and assign it as the value of 'studentName' in the output JSON object. If the Name label is not followed by a name on the same line or if the label does not exist, use 'NSUBUGA ETHAN' as the studentName. For the rest of the content, transcribe only the exam questions into an array of entries. Each entry must be a JSON object with exactly the following keys: 'questionNo', 'question', 'answer', and 'grading'. The output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n",
      "{ \"studentName\": \"<Extracted or default name>\", \"entries\": [ { \"questionNo\": \"<Question number>\", \"question\": \"<Question text>\", \"answer\": \"<Answer text>\", \"grading\": \"<Correct/Incorrect/Not Graded or empty string>\" }, ... ] } For questions with multiple parts (e.g., 36(a)), if there are multiple answers, produce a separate entry for each answer, repeating the question text for each part. If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks.\n",

If such a label exists and a name immediately follows it on the same line, extract that name and assign it as the value of 'studentName' in the output JSON object. If the Name label is not followed by a name on the same line or if the label does not exist, use 'NSUBUGA ETHAN' as the studentName. For the rest of the content, transcribe only the exam questions into an array of entries. Each entry must be a JSON object with exactly the following keys: 'questionNo', 'question', 'answer', and 'grading'. The output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n",

If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks.\n",

If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.

      "{ \"studentName\": \"<Extracted or default name>\", \"entries\": [ { \"questionNo\": \"<Question number>\", \"question\": \"<Question text>\", \"answer\": \"<Answer text>\", \"grading\": \"<Correct/Incorrect/Not Graded or empty string>\" }, ... ] } For questions with multiple parts (e.g., 36(a)), if there are multiple answers, produce a separate entry for each answer, repeating the question text for each part. If a question provides an option to answer either one part or the other, transcribe only the part that was answered. If the student hasn't answered, leave the 'answer' field empty. Grade each answer as 'Correct' if there is a red tick mark. If an answer has any marks other than a red tick mark and does not have a red tick mark, treat it as 'Incorrect'. If an answer contains a red tick mark along with other marks, treat it as 'Correct'. If no mark is present at all, grade it as 'Not Graded'. Ensure no extra spaces are added at the beginning or end of any text values, and ignore any non-exam instructions. Your response must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks.\n",
